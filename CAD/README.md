** There are 3 formats: f3d (for Autodesk Fusion), x_t (for SolidWorks, Onshape, and Shapr3D), and STEP. **
Importing STEP files are a lot slower than those propietery ones, pick the one that works best with your CAD software.

## What are the files
"stealburner_body v1" and "stealthburner_body v1 FB" are both the front cover for the Giano StealthBurner toolhead. However, the first one has the Voron logo, while the latter one has a Giano logo.

"Dual filament path" is the filament path / extruder chasis.
